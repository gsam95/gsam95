I'm passionate about blending data analytics with creative, human-centered design to drive real-world impact. In the Eval-AI project, we built a comprehensive compliance testing framework for generative AI â€” an initiative that sharpened my skills in agile development, red-teaming, and technical evaluation, ensuring that advanced models align with ethical and regulatory standards.
