## Policy Analysis  </br></br>

The policy memos showcased here leveraged a structured 8-step policy analysis process to analyze complex policy problems. They illustrate key skills including:
</br>
- **Critical Policy Thinking**: Evaluating how and when policy problems gain attention, avoiding common pitfalls, and assessing policy alternatives creatively.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Using both quantitative and qualitative analysis to measure policy impacts and anticipate implementation challenges.
- **Effective Communication**: Crafting clear, persuasive policy recommendations tailored to decision-makers.
- **Strategic Policy Development**: Designing innovative solutions and considering political, economic, and ethical implications.
- **Applied Problem-Solving**: Engaging with real-world scenarios to simulate working as a policy analyst in government or civic agencies.
</br>
These skills, combined with my background in data analytics and economics, allow me to integrate evidence-based research with practical policymaking strategies.
