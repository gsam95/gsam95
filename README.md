Hi, Iâ€™m Grace! Iâ€™m an economist turned data scientist, passionate about using data and technology to drive social impact. With a strong foundation in economics and advanced data analytics, I love tackling complex problemsâ€”building models, uncovering insights, and translating them into meaningful solutions. Whether itâ€™s machine learning, data visualization, or policy innovation, I bring curiosity, rigor, and a collaborative spirit to everything I do. I'm all about bridging the gap between data and real-world change. Letâ€™s connect and create something impactful!
