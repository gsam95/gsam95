#### Bio  

I'm particularly interested in understanding and addressing systems that systematically disadvantage certain groups; that limit their access to quality resources and propagate inequities.

Over the last few years I have honed my skills in data analysis and data science, and found it's a perfect fit to my temperament and skills. Applying my skills in the policy space has been exhilarating and I look forward to doing more of it in the coming years.


An amazing Econ teacher in high school made me fall in love with the subject, and again an amazing Econ professor inspired me to work in policy. Their love for their work brought me here:) to do what I love - learning new things and eventually to have a career at the intersection of data and policy.
